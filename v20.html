		<div>Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths,</div>
		<div>Enwrought with golden and silver light,</div>
		<div>The blue and the dim and the dark cloths</div>
		Of night and light and the half-light,
		I would spread the cloths under your feet:
		But I, being poor, have only my dreams;
		I have spread my dreams under your feet;
		Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.
