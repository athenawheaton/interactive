		Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths,
		Enwrought with golden and silver light,
		The blue and the dim and the dark cloths
		Of night and light and the half-light,
		I would spread the cloths under your feet:
		But I, being poor, have only my dreams;
		I have spread my dreams under your feet;
		Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.
