	<h1>Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths,</h1>
	<h2>Enwrought with golden and silver light,</h2>
	<h3>The blue and the dim and the dark cloths</h3>
	<h4>Of night and light and the half-light,</h4>
	<h5>I would spread the cloths under your feet:</h5>
	<h6>But I, being poor, have only my dreams;</h6>
	<h6>I have spread my dreams under your feet;</h6>
	<h6>Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.</h6>
