		Had I the <em>heavens'</em> embroidered cloths, Enwrought with golden and silver <em>light,</em> The blue and the <em>dim</em> and the dark cloths Of night and <em>light</em> and the half-<em>light,</em> I would spread the cloths <em>under</em> your feet: But I, being poor, have only my dreams; I have spread my dreams <em>under</em> your feet; Tread <em>softly</em> because you tread on my dreams.
