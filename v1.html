	<p>
		Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths,<br>
		Enwrought with golden and silver light,<br>
		The blue and the dim and the dark cloths<br>
		Of night and light and the half-light,<br>
		I would spread the cloths under your feet:<br>
		But I, being poor, have only my dreams;<br>
		I have spread my dreams under your feet;<br>
		Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.
